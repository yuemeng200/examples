[Anthropic API fundamentals](./anthropic_api_fundamentals/README.md) - teaches the essentials of working with the Claude SDK: getting an API key, working with model parameters, writing multimodal prompts, streaming responses, etc.\n2. [Prompt engineering interactive tutorial](./prompt_engineering_interactive_tutorial/README.md) - a comprehensive step-by-step guide to key prompting techniques. [[AWS Workshop version](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/0644c9e9-5b82-45f2-8835-3b5aa30b1848/en-US)]\n3. [Real world prompting](./real_world_prompting/README.md) - learn how to incorporate prompting techniques into complex, real world prompts. [[Google Vertex version](https://github.com/anthropics/courses/tree/vertex/real_world_prompting)] \n4. [Prompt evaluations](./prompt_evaluations/README.md) - learn how to write production prompt evaluations to measure the quality of your prompts.\n5. [Tool use](./tool_use/README.md) - teaches everything you need to know to implement tool use successfully in your workflows with Claude.\n\n**Please note that these courses often favor our lowest-cost model, Claude 3 Haiku, to keep API costs down for students following along with the materials. Feel free to use other Claude models if you prefer.**",
