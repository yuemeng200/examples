However, with the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.\n\n## Deploy Your Own\n\nYou can deploy your own version of the Next.js AI Chatbot to Vercel with one click:\n\n[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fai-chatbot&env=AUTH_SECRET,OPENAI_API_KEY&envDescription=Learn%20more%20about%20how%20to%20get%20the%20API%20Keys%20for%20the%20application&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fai-chatbot%2Fblob%2Fmain%2F.env.example&demo-title=AI%20Chatbot&demo-description=An%20Open-Source%20AI%20Chatbot%20Template%20Built%20With%20Next.js%20and%20the%20AI%20SDK%20by%20Vercel.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fchat.vercel.ai&stores=[{%22type%22:%22postgres%22},{%22type%22:%22blob%22}])\n\n## Running locally\n\nYou will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.\n\n> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various OpenAI and authentication provider accounts.\n\n1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`\n2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`\n3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`\n\n```bash\npnpm install\npnpm dev\n```\n\nYour app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).\n",
