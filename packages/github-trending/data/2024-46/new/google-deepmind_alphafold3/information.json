You may only use AlphaFold\n3 model parameters if received directly from Google. Use is subject to these\n[terms of use](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/blob/main/WEIGHTS_TERMS_OF_USE.md).\n\nAny publication that discloses findings arising from using this source code, the\nmodel parameters or outputs produced by those should [cite](#citing-this-work)\nthe\n[Accurate structure prediction of biomolecular interactions with AlphaFold 3](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07487-w)\npaper.\n\nPlease also refer to the Supplementary Information for a detailed description of\nthe method.\n\nAlphaFold 3 is also available at\n[alphafoldserver.com](https://alphafoldserver.com) for non-commercial use,\nthough with a more limited set of ligands and covalent modifications.\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact the AlphaFold team at\n[alphafold@google.com](mailto:alphafold@google.com).\n\n## Obtaining Model Parameters\n\nThis repository contains all necessary code for AlphaFold 3 inference. To\nrequest access to the AlphaFold 3 model parameters, please complete\n[this form](https://forms.gle/svvpY4u2jsHEwWYS6). Access will be granted at\nGoogle DeepMind’s sole discretion. We will aim to respond to requests within 2–3\nbusiness days. You may only use AlphaFold 3 model parameters if received\ndirectly from Google. Use is subject to these\n[terms of use](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/blob/main/WEIGHTS_TERMS_OF_USE.md).\n\n## Installation and Running Your First Prediction\n\nSee the [installation documentation](docs/installation.md).\n\nOnce you have installed AlphaFold 3, you can test your setup using e.g. the\nfollowing input JSON file named `alphafold_input.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"2PV7\",\n  \"sequences\": [\n    {\n      \"protein\": {\n        \"id\": [\"A\", \"B\"],\n        \"sequence\": \"GMRESYANENQFGFKTINSDIHKIVIVGGYGKLGGLFARYLRASGYPISILDREDWAVAESILANADVVIVSVPINLTLETIERLKPYLTENMLLADLTSVKREPLAKMLEVHTGAVLGLHPMFGADIASMAKQVVVRCDGRFPERYEWLLEQIQIWGAKIYQTNATEHDHNMTYIQALRHFSTFANGLHLSKQPINLANLLALSSPIYRLELAMIGRLFAQDAELYADIIMDKSENLAVIETLKQTYDEALTFFENNDRQGFIDAFHKVRDWFGDYSEQFLKESRQLLQQANDLKQG\"\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"modelSeeds\": [1],\n  \"dialect\": \"alphafold3\",\n  \"version\": 1\n}\n```\n\nYou can then run AlphaFold 3 using the following command:\n\n```\ndocker run -it \\\n    --volume $HOME/af_input:/root/af_input \\\n    --volume $HOME/af_output:/root/af_output \\\n    --volume <MODEL_PARAMETERS_DIR>:/root/models \\\n    --volume <DATABASES_DIR>:/root/public_databases \\\n    --gpus all \\\n    alphafold3 \\\n    python run_alphafold.py \\\n    --json_path=/root/af_input/fold_input.json \\\n    --model_dir=/root/models \\\n    --output_dir=/root/af_output\n```\n\nThere are various flags that you can pass to the `run_alphafold.py` command, to\nlist them all run `python run_alphafold.py --help`. Two fundamental flags that\ncontrol which parts AlphaFold 3 will run are:\n\n*   `--run_data_pipeline` (defaults to `true`): whether to run the data\n    pipeline, i.e. genetic and template search. This part is CPU-only, time\n    consuming and could be run on a machine without a GPU.\n*   `--run_inference` (defaults to `true`): whether to run the inference. This\n    part requires a GPU.\n\n## AlphaFold 3 Input\n\nSee the [input documentation](docs/input.md).\n\n## AlphaFold 3 Output\n\nSee the [output documentation](docs/output.md).\n\n## Performance\n\nSee the [performance documentation](docs/performance.md).\n\n## Known Issues\n\nKnown issues are documented in the\n[known issues documentation](docs/known_issues.md).\n\nPlease\n[create an issue](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/issues/new/choose)\nif it is not already listed in [Known Issues](docs/known_issues.md) or in the\n[issues tracker](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/issues).\n\n## Citing This Work\n\nAny publication that discloses findings arising from using this source code, the\nmodel parameters or outputs produced by those should cite:\n\n```bibtex\n@article{Abramson2024,\n  author  = {Abramson, Josh and Adler, Jonas and Dunger, Jack and Evans, Richard and Green, Tim and Pritzel, Alexander and Ronneberger, Olaf and Willmore, Lindsay and Ballard, Andrew J. and Bambrick, Joshua and Bodenstein, Sebastian W. and Evans, David A. and Hung, Chia-Chun and O’Neill, Michael and Reiman, David and Tunyasuvunakool, Kathryn and Wu, Zachary and Žemgulytė, Akvilė and Arvaniti, Eirini and Beattie, Charles and Bertolli, Ottavia and Bridgland, Alex and Cherepanov, Alexey and Congreve, Miles and Cowen-Rivers, Alexander I. and Cowie, Andrew and Figurnov, Michael and Fuchs, Fabian B. and Gladman, Hannah and Jain, Rishub and Khan, Yousuf A. and Low, Caroline M.
